This is a very rudimentary implementation of the 5 Day Weather Application.

It takes the infrastructure provided by create-react-app and adds upon it a simple React implementation, enabling the user to view the weather for the current day and the next 4 days.

To run the application locally, type "npm run" at the console.  The page will be available at localhost:3000.
